## to do...
- full study guide walkthrough
- handful more mocks
- the 5 video problems, again
- brush up on regex
- hammer out the details for sort, slice, splice, shift, unshift


## stats for 216

- 119 problems of various difficulty levels, I'd estimate the number is actually closer to 140/150 since there are a ton of problems I didn't copy over into my 216 directory from codewars, edabit, LC, etc.
- I also recorded myself live coding over 30 times and posted ~25 sessions onto a YouTube Channel
- in addition, I spent a large amount of time helping others/listening to others code and proctored quite a few mock interviews for study buddies and just other folks at similar points in the curriculm
