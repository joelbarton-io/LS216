- ??? *"being a first-class function"* vs *"functions are first-class objects"*
- using various `Object` class methods like `fromEntries`; using `[key, value]` when working with a object-as-array of arrays syntax

### passing functions as arguments to other functions
- "Functions are lists of statements that can have parameters whose values dictate some aspect of their behavior" (like what they return)
- 'function abstractions' -> facilitated by us defining *behavior* (some abstraction) as arguments to a function.
- functions objects that are another function's argument serve to provide supplemental behavior for the main function; allows the creator to **write an abstraction** as well as solve some specific problem, simultaneously.

### declarative programming with abstractions
- the practice of moving imperative operations into functions and increasing the abstraction level -> more declarative style
- moving from a standard `for` loop to an interation abstraction like `forEach` -> increases abstraction
  - allows us to focus on the "what needs to happen" question instead of "how to do X" (details)
- declarative solutions can lead to code that is more readable, concise, and robust (using built-in abstractions)

### list processing abstractions
- `sort` and the use of `signed` numbers; do any numbers work for the `+` and `-` conditional evaluations? I'm assuming that `0` must always be zero but, Look Into This.
