# 00:00-00:07 IN/OUT/RULES

- ask questions to fully understand the problem
  ### INPUT (count...type...sub-types)
  ### OUTPUT (type...order...sub-types)
- capture any explicit rules or prob-spec defs/concepts

# 00:07-00:13 VALIDATE

- write some original testcases

  - default input variations (empty...odd...misc)
  - core edge cases (permutations of hardest given test case)

- (come back to this as the problem comes into focus)

# 00:13-00:20 MANUAL AND ABSTRACT

- Manual pass using testcases to validate/illuminate any tricky areas

  - add more test cases as needed from this step

- solve the problem abstractly (summarize, take note of rules, types, and edge-cases)

  - identify the obvious sub problems, 1 sentence each (IMPORTANT!)
  - DS

# 00:20-00:30 DETAILS

- write out the steps to solve the problem (BREAK IT DOWN!)

# 00:30-00:40 IMPLEMENT

- translate steps to js code
- debug with intention
