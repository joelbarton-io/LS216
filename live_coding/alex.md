notes:

- always test your code
- using a great template (ethan's template)
- the problem is easy (not as easy as 109)
- do a ton of practice in front of people
- suleiman (nigerian guy)
- wish he had gotten stuck more before (under time pressure)
- check EVERY step as you go

- you have 40 minutes (but you really have an hour or so)
