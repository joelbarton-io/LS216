  - terms and phrases; establish problem domain
    - translate words and phrases into explicit requirements to establish their meaning for the problem
    -

  - input(s):
    1) is data type guaranteed?
    2) if wrong data type, how should `X` type be handled?
    3) is collection; all the col els guaranteed to be the "right" data type?

  ## considerations for:

  ### STRINGS:
  - what to do with "empty" strings
  - strings w leading || trailing || intermittent whitespaces
  - what constitutes a WORD for this problem?
  - "words" with leading/trailing non-alphanumeric or non-alphabetical chrs
  - does case matter for this problem?

  ### NUMBERS:
  - subtypes: +/- (ints, floats, specials)
  - +/- signed numbers
  - special numbers (`NaN -Infinity`)

  ### ARRAYS:
  - "empty" arrays (empty, sparse, has non-indexed object properties)
  - are all elements of the 'correct' type?

  ### OBJECTS:

  ### BOOLEANS:
  - true vs truthy
  - "false": `[false, null, undefined, NaN, 0, -0, '' ]`

  ### null/undefined:
  - making up elements in a sparse array
  - both are falsy
