- identify recursion; understand other people's implementations; practical use cases

- why use recursion? -> solve tricky problems elegantly; problems that can't be solved with an iterative approach
- how to break out of recusive loops? -> function must implement a 'base case' (exit condition) to begin unwinding the calls
- start @ base case, then build up until you've reached the initial invocation (e.g. factorial example starting at factorial(1))

- why care? -> problems involving node-based data structures (binary search tree);

"WRITING RECURSIVELY"
- bottom-up vs top-down (can only be achieved thru recursion) strategies to approaching problems with recursion versus iteration
